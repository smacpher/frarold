# Frarold
Ask me about food at the 5C's.

## Talk to me!
So far, you can only talk to me through the command line.

To do this, open Terminal and use the following command:
`python frarold/python_client.py`

## Dependencies
To use the Python CLI Client, you will need to install the
Dialogflow Python SDK here: 
https://github.com/dialogflow/dialogflow-python-client

To interact with the Google Cloud Functions that power Frarold directly
(to use any shell scripts in the scripts/ directory),
you will need to install the Google Cloud SDK found here:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads
